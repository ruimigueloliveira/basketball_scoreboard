# basketball_scorer

Our project "Basketball Scorer" could not be more specific, at least in relation to the name, to what we would have to do. The objectives were to implement a countdown timer in which the time started in 10 minutes, to present the results of both teams and also the absences, time discounts and the period in which the game is.
